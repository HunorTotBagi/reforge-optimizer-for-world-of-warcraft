# What is reforging?

The goal is to create a script that will return the optimal reforges for a World of Warcraft character.

In World of Warcraft, "reforging" was a game mechanic that allowed players to modify the secondary attributes on their gear. When reforging, players could visit an NPC called a Reforger, who would allow them to reallocate a portion of the secondary attributes on an item. Each item had certain secondary stats, such as critical strike rating, haste rating, mastery rating, or spirit (for healers). By using reforging, players could convert a portion of one secondary stat into another, thus customizing the item's distribution of stats to better suit their character's needs.

For example, a player might reforge some of their critical strike rating on a piece of gear into haste rating if they preferred a faster attack speed rather than a higher chance to critically hit. This system allowed players to fine-tune their characters' itemization based on their desired playstyle or current needs.
